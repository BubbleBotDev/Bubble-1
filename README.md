# Bubble

📋 | Multifunctional Discord bot published at the end of December 2020. An improved version of the older "Guard" bot from the same developers, which was released in March 2020. The bot was permanently disabled in mid-March 2021 for reasons such as: - Loss of hosting - Code leak into the network (including the token) - Hack into a bot account The bot code was officially released at the end of March 2021. Feel free to use the full code (or same engine) to create your own bots ❤ If you use this code to create public bots, we will be glad if you mention us somewhere (Titon and DiaxMan) 🤗
